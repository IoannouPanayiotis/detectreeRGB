This directory contains a notebook to train and test Mask R-CNN, and to deploy ITCfast.

The notebook for training and testing Mask R-CNN also includes code to export the predictions of Mask R-CNN back into a geospatial format, which can then be piped into the change_analysis script to determine chnages in the dynamics of trees in a site of interest.
